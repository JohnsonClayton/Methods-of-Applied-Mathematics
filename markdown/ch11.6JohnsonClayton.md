What do we expect?  
 - Oxygen concentration decreases as we are closer to the center (lower $r$) $\rightarrow$ diffusion equation 9.39:  

$$
D \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \frac{dC}{dr} \right) + M(r) = 0,
$$

where $M(r) < 0$ because cells are *consuming* oxygen.

First Growth Phase (Cont.)
========================================================
If we have a constant oxygen consumption rate, $M(r) = -A_0$ (is this a valid assumption?), and boundary conditions $0 < r < R(t)$, we can solve for $C$:  

$$
C(r) = c_1 - \frac{A_0}{6D} \left( R^2 - r^2 \right),
$$

where $c_1$ is the initial concentration of oxygen on the surface ($r=R(t)$).  

This solution is only valid while $C(r) > c_q$, since $c_q$ is the concentration of oxygen at which the tumor cells become quiescent.  

First Growth Phase (Cont.)
========================================================
What is the radius at which the tumor cells start to become quiescent, $r_q$?  
 - With $C(0) = c_q$ at $r = 0$ and $R = r_q$,  
 
$$
r_q = \sqrt{ \left( c_1 - c_q \right) \frac{6D}{A_0} }, \text{ where } c_1 > c_q,
$$

## Observations
 - The radius $r_q$ decreases with the difference $c_1 - c_q$,  
 - $r_q$ increases as the absorption rate $A_0$ decreases (?).
 
 Now, let's expand this model to include the radius of the tumor at time $t$.
