Physical Interpretations
========================================================

While $U - u_s > 1$, we have that 

$$
(U-u_s)^{\frac{5}{4}} > (U-u_s).
$$

However, since   

$$
\lambda_{\text{natural cooling}} = 0.0115, \\
\lambda_{\text{Newton cooling}} = 0.0288,
$$

the effective rate of natural cooling is lower than Newton cooling.

Summary of Equations
========================================================
Newton's law of cooling is

$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = \pm \frac{hS}{cm}(U-u_s).
$$

The natural law of cooling is 

$$
\frac{dU}{dt} = \pm \frac{h_1 S}{cm}(U-u_s)^{\frac{5}{4}}.
$$
