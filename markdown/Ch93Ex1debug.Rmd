### Ch9.3 Hot Water Heater: Debugging the Code

In this activity, we run a proposed program for the numerical solution of the ODE in Ch9.3 for the hot water heater.  The code has an error in it, so we will work on debugging strategies.

#### Intro Paragraph from Book

In the paragraph below, a screen shot is included from the book. This is shown for instructional purposes, in order to demonstrate how to interpret the information and parameters given in the book for use within our numerical program.  Note that you should typically **not** use this kind of screen shot for work that you submit for assignments in this class.  Instead, you will format your document in a professional manner using your own typesetting, consistent with directions given for the assignments.

The differential equation given by Equation (9.7) on page 231, along with our adaptation for RK4, is shown below. 

$$ \begin{aligned}
cm \frac{dU}{dt} &= q - hS \left(U - u_s \right) \\
 \frac{dU}{dt} &= \frac{q}{cm} -  \frac{hS}{cm}\left(U - u_s \right) 
\end{aligned}
$$


#### RK4 Numerical Solution

Here is the code for the numerical solution.  We will run it, and then try to track down the necessary corrections. 

```{r}
Ch93Ex1debug <- function(q,T) {

  #Chapter9.3 Model 
  #Perform Rk4 for temperature of water in hot water heater
  
  #q is the heat input of the hot water heater.   
  #T is the time length in hours for [0, T]
  N <- 3600*10   #N is the number of time nodes
  h <- 3600*T/N    #This is the time step size in seconds
  
  #System Parameters
  t0 <- 0
  u0 <- 15 
  us <- 15
  c <- 4200    
  m <- 250      
  h <- 12    
  S <- 3.06    
  
  #Slope function from ODE
  f <- function(U) {q/(c*m) - ((h*S)/(c*m))*(U - us)}  
 
  #Initialize vectors for time t and temperature U. 
  t <- rep(0, N)
  U <- rep(0, N)
  t[1] <- t0
  U[1] <- u0

  
  #Runge-Kutta Loop (Generate temperature vector U)
  for(i in 1:N) {
    a1 <- h*f(U[i]);                       #f = slope of U
    b1 <- h*f(U[i]+0.5*a1);                 #Half-step predictor 
    c1 <- h*f(U[i]+0.5*b1);                 #Half-step predictor 
    d1 <- h*f(U[i]+c1);                     #Full-step predictor 
    U[i+1] <- U[i]+(1/6)*(a1+2*b1+2*c1+d1);   #Next U value
    t[i+1] <- t[i] + h
    #cat("i = ", i,",", "a = ", a, "\n")
    #cat("i = ", i,",", "b = ", b, "\n")
    #cat("i = ", i,",", "c = ", c, "\n")
    #cat("i = ", i,",", "d = ", d, "\n")
    #cat("i = ", i,",", "xi = ", U[i], "\n")
  }

  #Plot results
  plot(t,U,                
        main = "Hot Water Heater Temperature",
        xlab = "t (Seconds)",           #x-axis label
        ylab = "Temperature (C)",       #y-axis label
        type="l",col="blue", 
        xlim=c(0,3600*T),               #x-axis range
        ylim=c(0,100)                   #y-axis range
       )
  
   legend("topright",
         legend = c("Temperature"),
         col=c("blue"),        #legend colors
         lty=c(1)             #lty = line type (for legend colors)
         )
}
```

####  Commands for Running Numerical Solution

The following commands should produce a graph similar to Figures 9.4 and 9.5  on page 233 of our book; see screen shots below. Is this the case?  

##### Figure 9.4
