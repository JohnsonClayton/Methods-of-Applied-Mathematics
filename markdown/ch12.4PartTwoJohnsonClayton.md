Wave Motion
========================================================
Equation 12.39:  

$$
C(x, t) = \begin{cases}
    0, & \text{ if } & t \lt \frac{x-a}{v} \\
    P(x-vt),  & \text{ if } & t \gt \frac{x-a}{v}.
\end{cases}
$$

This describes *wave motion*.

Wave Motion
========================================================
What happens when we are increasing time, $t$. Notice that $P(a) = P(x-vt)$ for some $x$ and $t$. This implies

$$
a = x - vt, \\
x = a + vt.
$$

Thus, we see that, as $t$ increases, we are moving in the positive $x$ direction. The *wave* of pollution is moving in the $+x$-direction with velocity, $v$.

Wave Motion
========================================================
Initializing system with a *wave* of pollution, $g(t)$, at boundary $a=0$. We assume no pollution in the lake at $t=0$. Graph shows levels of pollution in the lake for $a \leq x \leq b$, with $t = t+nh$, where $n = 1, 2, ...$ and $h = \pi$.

Pollution Reduction
========================================================
How long will it take a lake to decrease to $5\%$ of its current level of pollutant with a stream of fresh water as the feeder into the lake, with $g(t) = 0$ and $P(x, 0) \neq 0$, for some $x$ where $a \leq x \leq b$?    


 1) Concentration to Mass using $C = \frac{M}{V(x)}$, where $V = \Delta x \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}$ is the volume of water at location $x$.  

Pollution Reduction 
========================================================

 2) Since we have constant $\text{width}$ and $\text{depth}$, and $C \Delta x$ is a measure of mass, we can state  
 
 $$
 \begin{align*}
   \int_a^b C(x, t) dx &= 0.05 \int_a^b P(x) dx, \\
   \int_a^b P(x-vt) dx &= 0.05 \int_a^b P(x) dx, \\
   \int_{a-vt}^{b-vt} P(s)ds &= 0.05 \int_a^b P(x) dx. \\
 \end{align*}
 $$
